    "# A Lesson on Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello! Welcome to a guest lesson from Spencer. Spencer is a software engineer who works with data and machine learning models at [Picnic Health](https://picnichealth.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's lesson will be on feature engineering. You'll spend the class diving into some example data, developing features and building a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work individually but will check in with other's periodically to compare ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You're already running this notebook in Colab so good job! Now run the below cells to import packages and load data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan today is to build a classification model that predicts whether given a bunch of host's listing whether that host will receive a high number of reviews."

    "\n",
    "- Spend 10 minutes starting to look at the data\n",
    "- Check-in with your classmates to hear about what they have discovered\n",
    "- Remember you're trying to predict is a host has a `high_number_of_reviews` based on the host's listings.\n",
    "- Consider these questions\n",
    "  - Which columns do you think will best predict `high_number_of_reviews`?\n",
    "  - Are there columns with data that needs to be converted to a better format?\n",
    "  - How many listings are there per host?\n",
    "  - What should you do about null values?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Datatables\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a table indexed with `host_id` and containing two columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reviews_per_month` contains the total average number of reviews the host gets per month across all of their listings.\n",
    "- `high_number_of_reviews` contains a boolean (0 or 1) indicating if the total average number is above the median for all hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`listings`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This table contains a bunch of data. The `host_id` column can be used to join between this table and the `total_ratings_per_host` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table has a bunch of interesting challenges. Some starter code is provided to get you going."
